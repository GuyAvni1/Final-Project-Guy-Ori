# Codes
## 1. Model_Selection
  In this notebook, we are using df_imputed.csv file to classify patients into three categories: <br>
  CN - Cognitive Normal, MCI - Mild Cognitive Impairment, and AD - Alzheimer's Disease.<br>
  We represent classification with different model types to optimize our classification and results.<br>
  The goal is to find the best-fitted model for our problem.
  
## 2. Prediction_XXm
  Notebooks containing models to predict the future stage transition of a patient in different time spaces (12m,24m...).<br>
  The models are trained on data from the present of each patient and return a prediction of the patient's future stage transition.
